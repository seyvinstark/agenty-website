# Web dev — browser as context for better results

When improving **any aspect** of the website (content, design, layout, or behavior), use the browser so solutions are **visually grounded and appealing**:

1. **Use the browser MCP**: Work in the tab where the dev site runs (**http://localhost:5173**). Take a **snapshot** of the current page before changing anything, so you see the real layout, typography, and hierarchy. Use that view to shape your suggestions and code.
2. **Aim for visually appealing solutions**: Propose changes that look good in context — spacing, contrast, alignment, and tone should fit the live page. After implementing, take another snapshot (or reload then snapshot) to verify the result and refine if needed.
3. **One clear improvement per request**: Prefer one focused change per prompt (e.g. "make the hero CTA more prominent" or "tighten the Benefits copy") so each iteration stays easy to review and polish.
4. **Respect project constraints**: Use `tailwind.config.js` for theme (colors, fonts). Use `docs/section-snapshots.md` and `docs/section-snapshots/` for section order and copy reference.

**Flow**: Open or use tab at http://localhost:5173 → snapshot → improve (content or design) with the live view in mind → snapshot again to verify and ensure it's visually appealing.
