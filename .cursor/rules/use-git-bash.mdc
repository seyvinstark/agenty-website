# Always use Git Bash

When running **any** terminal command in this project:

1. **Use Git Bash syntax**: All commands must be bash-compatible (e.g. `&&` to chain, `export` for env vars, `/` for paths). Never use PowerShell or cmd syntax.
2. **Verify the shell**: If a command fails with a PowerShell-style error (e.g. `&&` is not a valid statement separator), re-run with `bash -l -c "..."` as a fallback.
3. **nvm is available**: Git Bash loads nvm via startup scripts. Use `nvm use` if the correct Node version matters (see `.nvmrc`).
